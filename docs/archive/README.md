# Archive

Historical documentation and reference materials.

## Contents

- **[integration-fixes.md](integration-fixes.md)** - Documentation of integration issues found and fixed during Phase 3 development (2026-01-30)

## Purpose

This directory contains historical documents that provide context about past decisions, bugs, and fixes but are no longer actively referenced in current development.

Documents are archived here instead of deleted to:
- Maintain institutional knowledge
- Provide context for future troubleshooting
- Document past mistakes to avoid repeating them
- Keep the main docs/ directory focused on current documentation
